# pipex - 42
Pipex project from the 42 cursus.

This is a fairly large project in which we must create a function that can mimic the Unix/Linux pipe, a command-line functionality which allows the output of a specified command/program to become to input for another specified command/program.

This project introduces many new concepts, including a few new functions like dup2(), fork(), pipe(), wait(), waitpid(), execve() and more. These new functions allow us to simulate redirection. All of these functions are quite complex and allow us to simulate the redirection capability of the Unix pipe.

Project completed on January 17 2024 with bonus (125/100).
